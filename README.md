# Little Kotlin Multiplatform Treasures

Accompanying code to my talk ["Little Kotlin Multiplatform Treasures"](https://london.droidcon.com/marc-reichelt/) at [Droidcon London 2022](https://london.droidcon.com/agenda/).

## Talk description

Kotlin is a world of beautiful islands and deep blue waters, full of little treasures to be discovered. Every traveler has heard of multiplatform and native, of course. But only the adventurous of you are ready to find the little gems.

Did you wonder what a Kotlin Native binary is made of? We'll have a deep look into its machinery, how to inspect binaries, and even disassemble a native Kotlin function using an open-source tool provided by the NSA. Then we will build our own treasure - a tiny Docker image with a Kotlin program.

We'll then sail over to the Multiplatform island and find out how multi-module projects can be achieved, how to build & distribute KMP libraries using Swift Package, Git & Artifactory, and how to speed up compilation in times of need.

Come along this journey - and be surprised what you'll find!
